## About the app
Checkill-Game is a game inspired by the checker game, but I think I want to improve it by adding skills to make it more fun. I created this project for learning how to create games and for fun.

## Technologies
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript.

## Setup
Download or clone this project, and then run it by double-clicking on the .html file or running it in Visual Studio Code with the extension named Live Server.
